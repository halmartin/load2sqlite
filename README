# This directory contains the Makefile for the OpenWRT build system
# The source code is contained inside
# the src/ directory to avoid having to download it separately.

# To build, you must have a copy of the OpenWRT source tree
# currently at version 15.05 (Chaos Calmer)
# instructions here: http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence
